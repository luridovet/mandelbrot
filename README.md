# Mandelbrot
Basic algorithm to draw the famous Mandelbrot, gods of fractal. Why is the file called Multibrot then? This code actually draws not only the mandelbrot set, but also his less known brothers. 
I'm not talking about the Julia Sets here. The Multibrot is the fractals which are built using the formula z -> z^d + c, when the original Mandelbrot set is created with z -> z^2 + c. 

My profile picture is the multibrot set with d = 3.
